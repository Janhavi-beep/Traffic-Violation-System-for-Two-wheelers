Traffic Violation System for Two-wheelers using Computer Vision.

This project is a Traffic Violation Detection System for Two-Wheelers developed using OpenCV, YOLOv5, and EasyOCR. It aims to automatically identify common traffic violations committed by two-wheeler riders using computer vision techniques. The system is capable of:

🚫 Helmet Detection – Identifies riders not wearing helmets.

👥 Triple Seat Detection – Detects if more than two people are riding on a two-wheeler.

🔍 Number Plate Detection and Recognition – Locates number plates and extracts vehicle numbers using OCR.

The goal is to assist traffic authorities in enforcing safety regulations and reducing manual surveillance by automating the violation detection process from images or video footage.
